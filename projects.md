Here is an overview of some of the open source projects that I worked on during the past years.

## CaffeJS - Running Caffe models in the browser

[CaffeJS][github-caffejs] started as a proof of concept for porting Caffe models to the browser using a modified version of [ConvNetJS (by Andrej Karpathy)](http://convnetjs.com). At first, I only wanted to parse Caffe architectures from `*.prototxt` in order to [visualize and analyze](https://chaosmail.github.io/caffejs/models.html) the flow of activations through the network.

After diving deep into DL model structures, I wondered if I could manage to load the model weights within JavaScript and perform a simple CPU based forward pass entirely in the browser. Turns out, that typed arrays in JavaScript are very powerful and can easily handle model weights from GoogLeNet to AlexNet models. I had to extend the ConvNetJS architecture to support DAG structures but I could reuse most of the Layer implementations. Here are screenshots of running an ImageNet classification task using a pretrained GoogLeNet and the `getUserMedia` API (to access the webcam in the browser) on a Desktop and mobile phone.

Finally, I wanted to get really funky and fix back propagation to allow backward passes as well for the Caffe models in the browser. To show that BP is working, I ported the Deep [Dream demo from Google](https://github.com/google/deepdream) to JavaScript; here is a screenshot of Deep Dream running entirely in the browser using a pretrained GoogLeNet Caffe model. This demo also uses WebWorkers for performing the computation in a background thread.

You can play around with GoogLeNet and all the demos directly in your browser on the [demos page][demo-caffejs] and find the [source on Github][github-caffejs].

## n3-line-charts - Awesome charts for Angular

2013 was the year of custom chart libraries, basically everyone ([including me](http://old.chaosmail.at/2013/angular-dchart/)) was building custom charting solutions based on RaphaelJS, plain SVG, D3.js or Canvas. Back then I realized that I don't want to put more effort into rebuilding existing functionality but rather contribute to an existing project. Therefore I looked around for the best charting library (for my needs) and got involved submitting PRs, fixing Issues and writing examples. This was the awesome library [n3-line-chart][github-n3charts]. I also realized, that it was tightly coupled to AngularJS which made it impossible to reuse it in different JS frameworks or simply VanillaJS. After some hangout discussions with the author [SÃ©bastien Fragnaud](https://github.com/lorem--ipsum) we quickly decided to rewrite the whole library in TypeScript and decouple it from AngularJS. On top we introduced a modular event-based architecture allowing to extend the functionality of the library easily.

And here it is today, an awesome, clean and extensible charting library.

You can take a look at the charts on our [examples page][demo-n3charts].

## python-fs - A pythonic filesystem wrapper for humans

When dealing with typical filesystem operations in Python, I quickly found myself rewriting a lot of similar functionalities again and again for every project, such as finding files in folders, dumping objects to disk,  dealing with prefixes etc. On top I found it very hard to remember which functionalities can be found in which std libs, such as `os`, `os.path`, `shutil`, etc. Hence I decided to write a small library to wrap all filesystem operations in one place with a `bash` like API - this is what became `python-fs` in the end.

Installing is straight forward using pip.

`pip install pyfs`

Here is a simple example of using `python-fs` to delete all `*.pyc` files in the `src/` directory.

```python
import fs
fs.rm( fs.find('*.pyc', path='src') )
```

You can find extensive documentation and many examples on th [Github page of the project][github-pyfs].
